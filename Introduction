Hi Everyone! I'm Kasturi Khanke, a second year Master's in the HCDE program. 
My background is in Industrial Design and digital fabrication holds a special place in my heart. 
This class looks like my 4 years of undergrad combined into 4 credits so I am super excited to learn more about 3D printing, molding and laser cutting. 
I hope to grow my skills in CAD and experiement around with physical models. 
I hope to teach peers anything and everything I know about digital fabrication from my undergrad experience.
